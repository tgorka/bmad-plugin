# Module Integration

How to add an upstream module to this repo.

Since v6.5.0.1 the official installer is the only thing that shapes plugin
content (`npx bmad-method@<tag> install --tools claude-code`). There is no
merge layer, no path rewriting and no per-module generator. Integration is
therefore mostly *registration*: one entry in
[`scripts/lib/upstream-sources.ts`](../scripts/lib/upstream-sources.ts), plus a
small amount extra depending on how the content reaches the plugin.

See [`docs/plan-6.11-rebuild.md`](plan-6.11-rebuild.md) for why the delivery
paths are split this way, and
[`docs/upstream-sync-design.md`](upstream-sync-design.md) /
[`docs/script-pipeline.md`](script-pipeline.md) for the retired multi-clone
pipeline (both are marked historical).

## The source registry

Every source is one `UpstreamSource` in `UPSTREAM_SOURCES`. The interface has
five fields and nothing else:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `id` | Unique identifier and the `.upstream-versions/<id>.json` stem; for a `custom` source it is also the `--<id>-tag` flag stem |
| `repo` | GitHub `org/repo`, used by the release watcher and for badge/table links |
| `label` | Short name shown in the README table and badge names |
| `enabled` | `false` drops the source from the version gate, the README table and badges, and the CI watcher. It does **not** remove it from `MODULES` / `CUSTOM_SOURCES` — the sync's own lists are independent |
| `kind` | How the content reaches the plugin |

`kind` decides the whole procedure:

| `kind` | Delivery | Pinned by | Currently |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core` | the installer itself | `v`-tag | `core` |
| `registry` | official module in upstream's `bmad-modules.yaml`, passed to `--modules` | `v`-tag (resolved by the installer) | `tea`, `bmb`, `cis`, `gds`, `bmad-loop` |
| `custom` | real BMad module absent from that registry; cloned at a tag, installed via `--custom-source` | `v`-tag | `manticore` |
| `vendored` | not installed at all; copied in as a plugin asset | full 40-char commit SHA | `module-template` |

## What registration already gives you

Do not hand-author any of this — it is generated from the registry entry:

- **Badge endpoint.** `scripts/update-readme-version.ts` writes
  `.github/badges/upstream-version-<id>.json` (`upstream-version.json` for
  `core`), creating the file from the registry when it does not exist yet and
  setting `message` from `.upstream-versions/<id>.json`.
- **README badge and dependency-table row.** Both blocks are regenerated
  between their marker comments (`<!-- upstream-badges-start -->` and
  `<!-- upstream-version-start -->`). The table shows label, version,
  delivery kind and `syncedAt`. `bun run sync` calls this at the end; run
  `bun run update-readme` to do it alone.
- **CI release watcher.** `scripts/list-sources.ts` emits the enabled,
  non-`vendored` sources as JSON; the `sources` job in
  [`.github/workflows/sync-upstream.yml`](../.github/workflows/sync-upstream.yml)
  turns that into the `check` job matrix. It runs weekly (Monday 00:00 UTC)
  and on `workflow_dispatch`, compares the pinned version against
  `repos/<repo>/releases/latest`, and opens one tracking issue per changed
  source carrying the correct per-kind sync command. There is no per-module
  job to copy any more.
- **Version gate.** `bun run validate` iterates `getEnabledSources()` and
  enforces the pin format for the source's `kind`
  (see [`docs/versioning.md`](versioning.md)).

A `vendored` source is deliberately absent from the watcher matrix: it has no
releases to compare against.

## `kind: 'registry'` — an official installer module

Preconditions: the module is listed in upstream's `bmad-modules.yaml` for the
core release you are pinning.

1. Add the registry entry:

   ```ts
   {
     id: 'bmad-loop',
     repo: 'bmad-code-org/bmad-loop',
     label: 'Loop',
     enabled: true,
     kind: 'registry',
   }
   ```

   **`id` must equal the module name in the installer's
   `_bmad/_config/manifest.yaml`** — `bmad-loop`, not `loop`.
   `bumpModuleVersions()` looks the id up in that manifest and exits non-zero
   when there is no entry, so a mismatched id is a hard failure rather than a
   silent skip.

2. Add the module code to `MODULES` in
   [`scripts/sync-from-installer.ts`](../scripts/sync-from-installer.ts):

   ```ts
   const MODULES = ['bmm', 'bmb', 'cis', 'gds', 'tea', 'bmad-loop'] as const;
   ```

   The list is always passed to the installer because `--yes` needs an
   explicit module list; core is force-added by the installer itself.

3. `bun run sync`
4. `bun run validate && bun run test:unit`

That is the whole procedure. You do not create the version file — the
installer resolves the module version and `bumpModuleVersions()` writes
`.upstream-versions/<id>.json` from `_bmad/_config/manifest.yaml`. `bmm` is
skipped there because it ships inside core and carries the core version.

Registry modules **cannot be bumped independently**: the installer resolves
them from the pinned core release. That is why the watcher issue for a
registry source says plain `bun run sync` rather than a tag flag — bumping one
means moving `--tag` for core.

## `kind: 'custom'` — a real module outside the registry

Preconditions: the repo ships `skills/module.yaml` (that is what makes it a
BMad module the installer can consume) and has a release tag. If it is not in
`bmad-modules.yaml`, `--modules` will not find it and `--custom-source` is the
only route.

### Worked example: `bmad-manticore`

1. **Registry entry**, `kind: 'custom'`:

   ```ts
   {
     id: 'manticore',
     repo: 'bmad-code-org/bmad-manticore',
     label: 'Manticore',
     enabled: true,
     kind: 'custom',
   }
   ```

2. **Create `.upstream-versions/<id>.json` by hand.** This is required and it
   is the one version file the sync does not bootstrap:
   `cloneCustomSources()` calls `readVersion(source.id)` before anything
   writes it. (Alternatively pass `--manticore-tag v1.0.1` on the first run;
   the clone step writes the file afterwards.)

   ```json
   { "version": "v1.0.1", "syncedAt": "2026-08-20" }
   ```

   Manticore is pinned to `v1.0.1`, the newest tag, even though `main`
   self-declares `3.1.0` — its `CHANGELOG.md` marks both `3.0.0` and `3.1.0`
   as unreleased and no tag above `v1.0.1` exists. The watcher picks up a real
   `v3.x` tag the day one lands.

3. **Decide whether it becomes its own plugin.** Manticore is a sibling
   plugin rather than more skills inside `bmad`, because:

   - its skills carry heavyweight prerequisites (ffmpeg, node/npx, uv,
     Python >= 3.11, multi-GB model caches) irrelevant to most users;
   - 14 of its 15 skills fail closed until `mc-setup` writes
     `[modules.manticore]` into `_bmad/custom/config.toml`;
   - `mc-agent` ("talk to Manny") is an always-on persona that would compete
     for activation with the aggregate's agents.

   A module whose skills are cheap, always usable and non-competing belongs in
   `plugins/bmad` instead — the sibling-plugin split costs the user an extra
   install and an extra `/bmad:init --with-plugin` flag.

   For a sibling plugin, create `plugins/<dir>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
   (hand-authored: `name`, `version`, `description`, `skills: "./skills/"`),
   a `plugins/<dir>/README.md`, and an entry in
   `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. `bun run validate` fails if a
   `plugins/<dir>` is not published, if `plugin.json`'s `name` or `version`
   disagrees with the marketplace entry, or if `skills/` is missing or empty.

4. **Add the `CUSTOM_SOURCES` entry** in `scripts/sync-from-installer.ts`:

   ```ts
   {
     id: 'manticore',
     repoUrl: 'https://github.com/bmad-code-org/bmad-manticore.git',
     pluginDir: 'bmad-manticore',
     moduleCode: 'manticore',
     skillPrefix: 'mc-',
   }
   ```

   `moduleCode` is the code the installer records at `_bmad/<code>/`;
   `skillPrefix` is how installed skill directories are routed to this plugin
   instead of the aggregate.

5. `bun run sync` (or `bun run sync -- --manticore-tag <tag>`)
6. `bun run validate && bun run test:unit`

Nothing to add to `.gitignore`: every throwaway checkout lands under
`.upstream-clones/<id>` and every throwaway install under
`.upstream-install-<id>/`, both already ignored. The patterns are
deliberately not widened to `.upstream-*`, which would swallow the
tracked `.upstream-versions/`.

### Why the sync clones locally and passes a path

`--custom-source` accepts either a URL or a local path. Given a **URL** the
installer resolves the repo's **default branch**, which moves — a re-run of a
pinned sync would produce different content. So `cloneCustomSources()` does
`git clone --depth 1 --branch <tag>` into `.upstream-<id>/` and hands the
installer that directory. The pin is enforced by git, not by the installer,
and the run stays reproducible offline once the clone exists.

### Why a second installer run

Each custom source gets its own throwaway install at
`.upstream-install-<id>/`, run with `--modules bmm --custom-source <clone>`.
Splitting the runs keeps each plugin's runtime template describing only the
modules that plugin ships — a `bmad`-only install must not advertise manticore
skills in its help catalog.

From that run the sync copies skill directories matching `skillPrefix` into
`plugins/<pluginDir>/skills/`, and captures only the module's own metadata,
`_bmad/<moduleCode>/{config.yaml,module-help.csv}`. The core runtime those
skills resolve against (`_bmad/scripts/resolve_config.py`, `_bmad/custom/`)
comes from the `bmad` plugin, which `/bmad:init` materialises first.

Registration in a working repo is opt-in:
`/bmad:init --with-plugin bmad-manticore` materialises the sibling's
`_bmad/<module>/` metadata and merges its `module-help.csv` rows into
`_bmad/_config/bmad-help.csv`. It is never inferred from the directory
listing, because a marketplace install is a git clone of the whole repo — a
sibling's files are on disk whether or not the user enabled the plugin.

## `kind: 'vendored'` — a plugin asset, not an install

Use this when the upstream content is not installable at all and only needs to
ship as reference material.

### Worked example: `bmad-module-template`

The module-authoring scaffold lands at
`plugins/bmad/templates/module-template/`. It is **not** published as a
marketplace plugin: its own `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` declares
`"skills": ["./skills/my-skill"]` and that directory exists in no upstream ref
— `skills/` holds a single empty `.gitkeep`, because an early `.gitignore`
line (`.*/skills`) swallowed the scaffold before it was committed. Publishing
it would put a dead entry named `my-module` in front of end users. See
[`plugins/bmad/templates/README.md`](../plugins/bmad/templates/README.md).

1. Registry entry, `kind: 'vendored'`.
2. `.upstream-versions/module-template.json` pinning a **full 40-char commit
   SHA** (`f1440ec80b9c8b13e0779dedd47487b74d634a02`) — the repo has no tags
   and no releases, and anything shorter (a branch name, an abbreviated SHA)
   would let the bundle mutate underneath us. `bun run validate` rejects
   anything else.
3. A copy step in the sync, plus a matching entry in `wipePluginTree()`.

Step 3 is **not generic**: `vendorModuleTemplate()` is written against
`MODULE_TEMPLATE_SOURCE` and the hard-coded `MODULE_TEMPLATE_DIR`, and
`wipePluginTree()` names that directory explicitly (only the vendored
scaffold, not the whole `templates/` dir, whose `README.md` is
hand-authored). A second vendored asset needs a second function and a second
wipe entry, or a refactor to drive both from the registry. There is exactly
one vendored source today, so that generalisation has not been paid for.

Two things to carry over from `vendorModuleTemplate()` if you write another:
the clone's `.git` is removed before copying, and any nested `.gitignore` is
stored as `dot.gitignore`. A live nested `.gitignore` would exclude sibling
files from *this* repo's git tree, and marketplace installs are git clones, so
those files would vanish from the shipped plugin. `bun run validate` fails on
a live nested `.gitignore` in vendored content.

## Edge cases

### The installer can silently drop a module's skills

The count a module declares and the count that installs are not the same
number, and nothing errors. Manticore's
`plugins/bmad-manticore/runtime/_bmad/manticore/module-help.csv` lists 16
skills (17 rows, one of which is `_meta`); `plugins/bmad-manticore/skills/`
contains 15. The missing one is `mc-audio`: its `SKILL.md` frontmatter is
invalid YAML — `description:` is an unquoted scalar containing `": "` — so
`yaml.parse` throws, the installer's `parseSkillMd()` returns null, and the
skill never reaches `skill-manifest.csv`. Fixed on upstream `main`, still
broken at `v1.0.1`; documented, not patched, because rewriting installer
output is precisely the merge layer this pipeline exists without.

The sync handles the catalog half of this automatically:
`pruneUnshippedHelpRows()` drops any help row naming a skill the installer
did not install, and `bun run validate` fails if one survives — a row for a
missing skill would make `bmad-help` offer and route into nothing. That is
why the vendored `module-help.csv` carries 16 rows (15 skills plus
`_meta`) against upstream's 17.

What the sync cannot repair is a dead cross-reference inside another
skill's prose: `mc-graphics`, `mc-setup` and `mc-stream-pack` all delegate
sound work to `mc-audio` by name. Check for those by hand when a module
under-installs.

### A module can depend on a skill the installer stops installing by default

The sibling of the case above, and the reason the sync passes `--shims` —
its one deliberate divergence from the installer's defaults.

Core v6.12.0 made the v6 deprecation shims opt-in: `--shims` /
`--no-shims`, declined by default in a non-interactive install, and the
interactive prompt recommends declining. Upstream's own
`v6-shims/README.md` was not updated and still says they ship by default,
so it cannot be used to decide this either way.

What decides it is what the bundled modules actually reference. GDS v0.7.2
names three shim IDs in content that is executed, not narrated:

```sh
# live instructions
grep -rn 'bmad-review-adversarial-general' plugins/bmad/skills/gds-*
# live configuration
grep -rn '"skill:bmad-editorial-review' plugins/bmad/skills/*/customize.toml
```

Without `--shims` the tree drops from 111 skills to 90, and five game-dev
skills instruct the agent to invoke skills that are not installed.

`bun run validate` turns this from a comment into a check: it resolves
every `"skill:<id>"` value in every `customize.toml` against the shipped
skill set. Those values are live config the skill dispatches on, unlike
prose that merely mentions an old name — which is why the check reads
TOML and not Markdown. When GDS stops naming them, the gate goes quiet and
the flag can be dropped.

### Per-module artifact defaults can point at `{project-root}/skills/`

Some modules ship output paths that collide with the working repo's own
`skills/` directory. In the current tree:

```
plugins/bmad/runtime/_bmad/bmb/config.yaml:6: bmad_builder_output_folder: "{project-root}/skills"
plugins/bmad/runtime/_bmad/bmb/config.yaml:7: bmad_builder_reports: "{project-root}/skills/reports"
plugins/bmad/runtime/_bmad/gds/config.yaml:7: planning_artifacts: "{project-root}/skills/planning-artifacts"
plugins/bmad/runtime/_bmad/gds/config.yaml:8: implementation_artifacts: "{project-root}/skills/implementation-artifacts"
plugins/bmad/runtime/_bmad/tea/config.yaml:6: test_artifacts: "{project-root}/skills/test-artifacts"
```

The same values appear in `plugins/bmad/runtime/_bmad/config.toml`. These are
upstream defaults captured verbatim, so a user running a bmb/gds/tea workflow
writes generated artifacts into `<repo>/skills/…`, which in a plugin repo is
source. The sync does not rewrite them — rewriting installer output is exactly
the merge layer that was deleted — so a new module with paths like this needs
the collision called out in the plugin README and overridden in the user's
`_bmad/custom/config.toml`.
