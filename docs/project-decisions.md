# BMAD Plugin - Project Decisions & Plans

> **📌 Superseded (2026-08-20). Historical document.** The blockquote and
> sections below record the original planning sessions and are kept as a
> record of them. They are **no longer the source of truth**, and several
> architectural decisions in them were reversed. Current state:
> [docs/plan-6.11-rebuild.md](plan-6.11-rebuild.md) for the v6.11.0
> rebuild and its rationale, [docs/bmad-ecosystem.md](bmad-ecosystem.md)
> for the module inventory, and
> [docs/upstream-sync-design.md](upstream-sync-design.md) for the
> pipeline.
>
> What specifically no longer holds, verified against the tree on
> 2026-08-20:
>
> - **"Roles -> Subagents" (section 4) was reversed. Agents ship as
>   skills.** There is no subagent layer and no `plugins/bmad/agents/`
>   directory — `ls plugins/bmad` returns `README.md`, `commands`,
>   `runtime`, `scripts`, `skills`, `templates`. Personas are ordinary
>   skills (`bmad-agent-*`, `bmad-cis-agent-*`, `gds-agent-*`), and the
>   roster lives in the `[agents.*]` tables of
>   `plugins/bmad/runtime/_bmad/config.toml` (17 entries: bmm 5, cis 6,
>   gds 5, tea 1).
> - **The target tree in section 7 does not describe this repo.**
>   `plugins/bmad/skills/` is flat — 111 sibling skill directories, no
>   `workflows/` or `knowledge/` split. `plugins/bmad/commands/` holds one
>   file, `init.md`; there is no `status.md`. `plugins/bmad/templates/`
>   holds `README.md` and the vendored `module-template/`, not document
>   templates.
> - **Content is generated, not authored.** Since v6.5.0 the plugin tree
>   is a full regeneration: `bun run sync` wipes `skills/` and `runtime/`
>   and rebuilds them from a real installer run. The per-file progress
>   tracker in section 12 describes a hand-curated tree that no longer
>   exists.
> - **Two plugins, not one.** `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` publishes
>   `bmad` (6.11.0.0) and `bmad-manticore` (1.0.1).
> - **The upstream slug moved.** Sections 2, 6 and 11 say
>   `bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD`; the canonical slug is
>   `bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD`.
> - **The install path moved.** Section 5 says
>   `/plugin marketplace add PabloLION/bmad-plugin`; README now uses
>   `tgorka/bmad-plugin` throughout. `marketplace.json`'s `owner` block
>   still records the fork parent.
> - **`check-workarounds.yml` is gone** (section 12), deleted with the
>   workaround it monitored. `.github/workflows/` now holds `ci.yml`,
>   `claude-code-review.yml`, `claude.yml`,
>   `dependency-submission.yml` and `sync-upstream.yml`.
>
> The open questions in section 9 and the pending items in section 12 are
> historical; do not pick work up from them.

> Decisions made during planning sessions. This is our source of truth.

## 1. Project Goal

Create a **proper Claude Code plugin** for BMAD Method that:

- Installs via `/plugin install bmad`
- Supports versioning and auto-updates
- Listed in official plugin registry (discoverable)
- Follows Claude Code plugin architecture correctly

---

## 2. Source of Truth

| Repository                        | Purpose                       | Stars |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----- |
| **bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD**          | Official source (v6 alpha)    | 31.7k |
| aj-geddes/claude-code-bmad-skills | Reference only (format ideas) | 210   |

**Decision:** Source content from official `bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD`, NOT from AJ's
community version.

**Rationale:**

- When official BMAD updates → our plugin updates
- Not dependent on community fork maintenance
- Direct alignment with BMAD creators

---

## 3. Version Alignment

- Align to **BMAD Method v6** (official version)
- Use alpha content as-is (they provide it, we use it)
- Track official releases for updates

---

## 4. Architecture Decisions

### AJ's Mistake (What NOT to do)

AJ modeled **roles as skills**. This is architecturally incorrect.

### Our Correct Approach

| BMAD Concept                                                                      | Claude Code Component       | Why                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Roles** (Business Analyst, PM, Architect, Developer, Scrum Master, UX Designer) | **Subagents**               | Roles are personas with isolated context, specific tools, potentially different models |
| **Workflows** (product-brief, prd, architecture, sprint-planning)                 | **Skills** (task type)      | Workflows are step-by-step processes invoked by user                                   |
| **Methodology knowledge** (BMAD concepts, helpers)                                | **Skills** (knowledge type) | Reference material Claude should know                                                  |
| **User commands** (/init, /status)                                                | **Commands**                | Direct user invocation                                                                 |

---

## 5. Distribution Strategy

### Decision: Publish to BOTH

1. **Self-hosted marketplace** on GitHub
   - Immediate availability
   - Full control over updates
   - Users: `/plugin marketplace add PabloLION/bmad-plugin`

2. **Official Anthropic registry**
   - Submit via
     [clau.de/plugin-directory-submission](https://clau.de/plugin-directory-submission)
   - Discoverability in official listing
   - Review process required

### Marketplace Name

- **`bmad-method`** (matches upstream project name)
- Cannot use reserved names like `claude-plugins-official`, `anthropic-*`, etc.

---

## 6. CI/CD: Upstream Sync

### GitHub Action: Watch Official BMAD-METHOD

**Purpose:** Automatically check if `bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD` has updates.

**Trigger:**

- Scheduled (daily/weekly cron)
- Manual dispatch

**Workflow:**

1. Check latest release/commit of `bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD`
2. Compare with our tracked version
3. If different:
   - Create issue or PR notifying of upstream changes
   - Optionally: auto-generate diff of what changed
4. Manual review and update by maintainer

**File:** `.github/workflows/sync-upstream.yml`

```yaml
# Conceptual structure
name: Check BMAD Upstream
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 1" # Weekly on Monday
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  check-upstream:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD for updates
        # Compare latest release/tag with our tracked version
        # Create issue if update detected
```

## 8. Documentation to Keep

| File                                      | Decision                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `docs/research.md`                        | Keep - valuable planning info      |
| `docs/claude-code-plugin-architecture.md` | Keep - reference for plugin format |
| `docs/project-decisions.md`               | Keep - this file, our decisions    |

---

## 9. Open Questions

- [x] What is the exact structure of official BMAD v6? — explored and mapped
- [ ] Which workflows are required vs optional?
- [ ] What license should we use? (need to check BMAD's license)
- [x] Plugin name: **`bmad`** (shorter for daily use: `bmad:init` vs `bmad-method:init`)
- [x] How to handle BMAD templates? — copied from upstream via sync script

---

## 10. Reference Commit Workflow

When experimenting with approaches that may not work, use git commits as
documentation:

1. Commit working baseline
2. Experiment with new approach
3. If it works: commit as reference snapshot
4. Revert to clean state (before experiments)
5. Reapply the correct solution cleanly

This creates a git history where future developers can see what was tried, what
worked, and what didn't. Dead-end commits document failed approaches so they
aren't retried.

**Example from this project:**

```text
9171e5c test: confirmed working workaround (REFERENCE — reverted after capture)
fa262be feat: commands/ wrappers approach (dead end — reverted)
91ee90f refactor: reorganize into plugins/bmad/ (KEEP)
```

Commits `fa262be` and `9171e5c` were reverted after confirming the working
approach. The clean workaround was then reapplied on top of `91ee90f`.
