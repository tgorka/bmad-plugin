# Release Process

## Quick Release

```sh
./scripts/release.sh <new-version>

```

The script handles:

- Version bump in `.plugin-version`, `package.json`, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`
- README version line update via `bun run update-readme`
- Git commit and tag
- Push and GitHub release creation
