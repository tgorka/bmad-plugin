# BMad working-repo initializer.
#
# The plugin ships the immutable skill surface; skills additionally
# resolve per-project files from {project-root}/_bmad/ (module config,
# shared scripts like memlog.py / render_skill.py, help catalogs) and
# write artifacts to configured output folders. This script creates
# those working-repo files from the runtime template captured at sync
# time (plugins/bmad/runtime/_bmad/).
#
# Usage:
#   init.sh [target-dir] [--dry-run] [--with-plugin <name>]...
#           [--shared-custom <dir>]
#
# --with-plugin registers a sibling BMad plugin from the same
# marketplace (e.g. bmad-manticore): its module runtime is materialized
# and its help rows are merged into _bmad/_config/bmad-help.csv. It is
# opt-in because a marketplace install clones the whole repo, so a
# sibling's files are on disk whether or not that plugin is enabled.
#
# --shared-custom points this repo's _bmad/custom/ at a directory you
# keep outside the project, so one set of skill overrides serves every
# repo instead of being copy-pasted into each. BMAD itself has no
# home-directory config layer — every layer it reads lives under
# {project-root}/_bmad — and a symlink at exactly this seam is what
# makes sharing work: custom/ is the only user-owned layer, so init
# never rewrites it, while project_name and the module config stay
# per-repo. Existing custom files are moved into the shared directory
# on first use, never overwritten.
#
# Idempotent: a missing file is created, an installer-managed file whose
# content differs from the shipped template is refreshed, and
# _bmad/custom/** is left alone. Safe to re-run after a plugin update.
