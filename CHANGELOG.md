## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`/bmad:init --shared-custom <dir>`** — link `_bmad/custom/` at a
  directory outside the project so one set of skill overrides serves
  every repo instead of being copy-pasted into each.

  BMAD has no home-directory config layer: every layer
  `_bmad/scripts/config_utils.py` reads is under `{project-root}/_bmad`,
  and `~/_bmad` is explicitly rejected upstream —
  `resolve_customization.py` puts the working directory first precisely
  so a `~/_bmad` "would otherwise mask the real project's overrides".
  There is an ancestor walk, but it is nearest-wins rather than layered,
  and skills pin `--project-root` anyway, which bypasses it.

  `custom/` is the only layer the installer and `/bmad:init` never
  rewrite, which makes it the one safe seam to share; everything else
  under `_bmad/` is installer-managed and genuinely per-project, so
  `project_name` and the module config stay local. Existing overrides are
  moved into the shared directory, a file the shared directory already
  owns is never clobbered (the other repos sharing it would silently
  inherit this one's version), re-running is a no-op, and repointing an
  existing link is refused rather than done silently.
- `favicon.svg` and `favicon.ico` at the repo root, copied verbatim from
  BMAD-METHOD's `docs-site/public/`, and shown beside the README title.
  Upstream's TRADEMARK.md puts the BMad mark outside the MIT grant, so
  the README records the source and states plainly that this is an
  unofficial, unendorsed redistribution.

### Fixed

- The sibling-merge test copied all 1,543 files under `plugins/` into a
  temp directory inside bun's 5s default timeout, and overran it often
  enough to be a real flake (reproduced on `main`: one run in two failed
  with a knock-on `init.sh exited with 143`). It now copies only the
  three subtrees `init.sh` reads — 35 files.

## [6.12.0.0] - 2026-09-13

Upstream sync: BMAD-METHOD **v6.11.0 → v6.12.0**. Module bumps, all read
back from the installer's own `_bmad/_config/manifest.yaml`: BMB v2.2.1 →
**v2.2.2**, CIS v0.3.1 → **v0.3.2**, GDS v0.7.1 → **v0.7.2**, TEA v1.23.3
→ **v1.26.0**, BMad Loop v0.11.0 → **v0.11.1**. BMad Manticore stays on
**v1.0.1** and the module template on **f1440ec8** — neither has moved
upstream. Skill count **110 → 111**.

### Changed

- **The sync now passes `--shims`, and that is the pipeline's one
  deliberate divergence from the installer's defaults.** v6.12.0 made the
  v6 deprecation shims opt-in; the installer gained `--shims` /
  `--no-shims`, a non-interactive install defaults to declining them, and
  the interactive prompt says "Recommended: No".

  That default is right for a single-module install and wrong for this
  bundle, because GDS v0.7.2 still depends on three shim IDs — in live
  instructions and live configuration, not in prose:

  - `gds-quick-dev/step-oneshot.md:22` — "Invoke the
    `bmad-review-adversarial-general` skill in a subagent"
  - `gds-code-review/steps/step-02-review.md:21`,
    `gds-quick-dev/step-04-review.md:28`
  - `gds-ux/customize.toml:80-81`,
    `gds-create-game-brief/customize.toml:67-68` — `doc_standards`
    listing `"skill:bmad-editorial-review-structure"` and
    `"skill:bmad-editorial-review-prose"`

  Installing with the new default produced a 90-skill tree in which five
  game-dev skills instruct the agent to invoke skills the plugin does not
  contain. Note this is **not** the v6.11.0.0 argument restated: that one
  quoted upstream's `v6-shims/README.md`, which v6.12.0 has left stale.
  This one is measured from the shipped GDS files.
- `bmad-checkpoint-preview` is renamed `bmad-walkthrough` (`CK` → `WT`)
  upstream; the old ID forwards, so both ship.

### Added

- **A gate for the divergence.** `bun run validate` resolves every
  `"skill:<id>"` value in every `customize.toml` against the shipped
  skill set. Those are live config a skill dispatches on, unlike prose
  that merely mentions an old name, so a dangling one is a broken
  cross-module call. Mutation-verified: removing
  `bmad-editorial-review-structure` fails validate and names both GDS
  files that depend on it. When GDS stops referencing them the gate goes
  quiet and `--shims` can be dropped.

### Upstream notes worth knowing

Two v6.12.0 renames break custom overrides: `persistent_facts` now ships
empty (re-add `project-context.md` to your override if you relied on the
auto-load), and `{diff_output}` is now `{diff_file}`. Build no longer
auto-triggers on interactive edits, git bookkeeping or formatting chores
and sizes its own ceremony after investigating; review triage logs a
verdict and evidence per finding; `bmad-project-context` adopts a
handwritten `AGENTS.md` rather than rewriting it.

### Fixed

- **`scripts/release.sh` could not cut a release.** Three defects, all hit
  while releasing v6.11.0.0, which had to be tagged by hand:
  - It required the `dev` branch, retired as the trunk in v6.11.0.0, and
    opened a `dev` → `main` PR. It now runs from `main`, and when the
    version anchors already carry the target version — the normal shape of
    a sync release — it runs the gates and tags in one pass with no branch
    and no PR.
  - The bump step used `sed -i ''`, the BSD-only in-place form. On GNU sed
    that reads the empty string as the script and the expression as a
    filename, so under `set -euo pipefail` the run aborted after
    `.plugin-version` had been rewritten but before the three JSON
    manifests — a partial bump that then tripped the clean-tree
    precondition on every retry. Replaced with the attached-suffix form
    both seds accept, and followed by `bun run validate`, which requires
    all four anchors to agree, so a partial bump cannot reach a PR.
  - `bd sync` ran unguarded under `set -e`, so a `bd` that is present but
    incompatible killed the release *after* the bump commit, leaving a
    release branch with no PR. It is now a warning.
- Release notes are taken from the `## [<version>]` CHANGELOG section
  rather than `--generate-notes`, which for a sync release emits a commit
  list covering ~1,900 regenerated files.
- New preconditions: local `main` must be identical to `origin/main`
  (tagging a local-only commit publishes an unresolvable tag), and the
  gates run before tagging on the no-bump path.

## [6.11.0.0] - 2026-08-20

From-scratch rebuild against BMAD-METHOD **v6.11.0**, not an incremental
bump. Module bumps: BMB v2.1.0 → **v2.2.1**, TEA v1.19.0 → **v1.23.3**,
BMad Loop v0.8.0 → **v0.11.0**, CIS → **v0.3.1**, GDS → **v0.7.1**.
Skill count **103 → 110** in the `bmad` plugin (core 14 + bmm 35 + gds 33
+ tea 10 + cis 10 + bmb 5 + loop 3), plus a second plugin shipping 15
more. Rationale for every decision below:
[docs/plan-6.11-rebuild.md](docs/plan-6.11-rebuild.md).

### Changed — policy reversals

- **Deprecated shims now ship. The sync no longer prunes them.** Two
  independent reasons. First, correctness: upstream's own
  `src/core-skills/v6-shims/README.md` states "External module repos
  (gds, loop, tea, bmb, os-utils) still invoke these IDs, so they ship by
  default. Removal rides the v7 cut — never a 6.x minor" — pruning them
  in a 6.x minor breaks cross-module invocation. Second, the gate had
  already stopped working: `pruneDeprecatedSkills()` matched a
  `description` starting with the literal uppercase `DEPRECATED`, and
  v6.11.0 writes `'Deprecated — forwards to bmad-prd (create intent).'`,
  so it matched **zero** skills while still reporting success — as did
  the companion check in `bun run validate`. Two of the twenty shims
  (`bmad-create-story` 23 KB, `bmad-dev-story` 26 KB) are full-bodied
  skills rather than forwarders, so the prune was never a no-op either.
  `pruneDeprecatedSkills()` and the CSV manifest scrub it fed are gone.
- **bmad-loop installs as a registry module.** Core v6.11.0 added
  `bmad-modules.yaml` at its repo root, in which `bmad-loop` is an
  official entry. The bespoke git-clone (`syncLoopSkills()`,
  `--loop-tag`, `.upstream-loop/`) was overwriting the installer's own
  output with tag-pinned copies; it is deleted and `bmad-loop` joins
  `--modules`. `.upstream-versions/loop.json` → `bmad-loop.json` so the
  id matches the installer manifest name, which is what
  `bumpModuleVersions()` keys on.

### Added

- **A second plugin: `bmad-manticore`** (upstream v1.0.1, 15 `mc-*`
  skills) — an AI video production pipeline. Manticore is a real BMad
  module (`skills/module.yaml`, `code: manticore`) but is absent from
  upstream's registry, so the sync clones it at a pinned tag and installs
  it through `--custom-source` from a **local path**; a URL would
  resolve the moving default branch and make the bundle irreproducible.
  It gets its own installer run so the `bmad` plugin's runtime template
  does not advertise skills that plugin does not ship.
  Separate plugin rather than 15 more skills in the aggregate: its
  prerequisites (ffmpeg, node/npx, uv, Python ≥ 3.11, multi-GB model
  caches) are irrelevant to most users, 14 of its 15 skills fail closed
  until `mc-setup` writes `[modules.manticore]` into
  `_bmad/custom/config.toml`, and `mc-agent` is an always-on persona
  that would compete for activation with the aggregate's agents.
  Pinned to the tag `v1.0.1`: upstream `main` self-declares `3.1.0` but
  its CHANGELOG marks both `3.0.0` and `3.1.0` as `- Unreleased` and no
  tag exists above `v1.0.1`.
  Two upstream defects at that tag are documented, not patched:
  `mc-audio`'s frontmatter is invalid YAML (`description:` is an
  unquoted scalar containing `": "`), so the installer's
  `parseSkillMd()` drops it and 16 declared skills install as 15; and
  `mc-agent` is not written into the core `config.toml` agent roster.
- **Vendored module-authoring scaffold** at
  `plugins/bmad/templates/module-template/`, pinned by commit
  `f1440ec8` (the repo has no tags). Deliberately **not** published as a
  marketplace plugin: its own manifest declares
  `"skills": ["./skills/my-skill"]` and that directory exists in no
  upstream ref — an early `.gitignore` rule (`.*/skills`) swallowed the
  scaffold — so a plugin entry would be a dead `my-module` in front of
  end users.
- **`/bmad:init --with-plugin <name>`** registers a sibling plugin from
  the same marketplace: materializes its `_bmad/<module>/` metadata and
  merges its help rows into `_bmad/_config/bmad-help.csv`. Opt-in, never
  inferred from the directory listing — a marketplace install is a git
  clone of the whole repo, so a sibling's files are on disk whether or
  not that plugin is enabled; `/bmad:init` decides from its own loaded
  skill list.
- **`uv` preflight in `/bmad:init`.** `bmad-build` and
  `bmad-build-auto` carry no workflow logic in v6.11 — they run
  `uv run _bmad/scripts/render_skill.py` and HALT if `uv` is missing.
  init warns (never fails) with install instructions.
- Runtime template gained `_bmad/render/` (content-addressed skill
  snapshots), `_bmad/scripts/render_skill.py`,
  `_bmad/scripts/config_utils.py`, and `_bmad/bmad-loop/`.
- `scripts/list-sources.ts` emits the source registry as JSON;
  `.github/workflows/sync-upstream.yml` builds its job matrix from it,
  replacing six copy-pasted per-module jobs. Registering a source is now
  the only edit needed to get a README row, a badge and a watcher.

### Fixed

- **The vendored runtime shipped the syncing operator's user name.**
  `user_name: Dev` was baked into `config.user.toml` and all seven
  per-module `config.yaml` files. Templatized as `__BMAD_USER_NAME__`,
  substituted by init from `git config user.name` (falling back to
  `$USER`). Install timestamps in `_config/manifest.yaml` likewise
  become `__BMAD_INSTALL_DATE__`.
- **`cis.json` and `gds.json` were transposed.** The v6.10 sync recorded
  cis v0.6.0 / gds v0.2.1 while its own `_bmad/_config/manifest.yaml`
  said cis v0.2.1 / gds v0.6.0. Both are now read back from the manifest,
  so CIS moving to v0.3.1 is a correction, not a downgrade.
- **README badges pointed at this repo's fork parent.**
  `GITHUB_RAW_BASE` was `PabloLION/bmad-plugin`, so every version badge
  rendered the parent's pins rather than ours. Also corrected the core
  repo slug `bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD` → `bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD`.
- **`bmad-help.csv` merge corrupted the last row.** The installer writes
  the file without a trailing newline; appending a sibling module's rows
  glued the first one onto the last existing row (producing a 12-column
  line) and re-appended it on every subsequent run. init pads the newline
  first, and the merge is dedupe-checked per row.
- `init.sh` treated an unknown option as the target directory. Argument
  parsing is now a shift loop and rejects unknown flags.

### Removed

- `bmad-index-docs`, `bmad-shard-doc`,
  `bmad-check-implementation-readiness` (folded into
  `bmad-sprint-planning`'s readiness gate) and `bmad-agent-tech-writer`
  (Paige retired) — all removed upstream in v6.11.0, with no replacement
  shim. The game-scoped `gds-agent-tech-writer` is unaffected.
- `.github/workflows/check-workarounds.yml` — it monitored a workaround
  `docs/workarounds.md` records as resolved on 2026-02-03, and asserted a
  `commands` array in plugin.json that no longer holds skills.

### Fixed after adversarial review

Two review passes over this stack found defects that were green on every
gate; all are fixed here, each mutation-verified.

- **`/bmad:init` could only seed a repo, never upgrade one.** It skipped
  every existing path, so a repo initialized under v6.10 kept its stale
  shared scripts, a help catalog naming eight removed skills while
  omitting 34 shipped ones, and the `user_name = "Dev"` leak — making
  "safe to re-run after a plugin update" false in exactly the case it
  was written for. `_bmad/custom/**` is now the user-owned layer and is
  never touched; everything else is refreshed when it differs from the
  template.
- **Substituted values could make the runtime unparseable.** A git
  identity containing `"`, `:`, `#` or `\` landed raw inside a TOML
  string and an unquoted YAML scalar, breaking `resolve_config.py` —
  which every skill calls. A literal newline aborted init mid-write,
  unrecoverably. Values are now reduced to a set safe in both formats.
- **An interrupted version bump was unrecoverable.** `.plugin-version`
  was written before the three JSON manifests, so a re-run read the
  advanced value, decided there was nothing to do, and left the
  manifests behind forever. It is written last, the patch counter
  survives a re-sync, and `validate` now requires all four anchors to
  agree.
- **The release watcher could never file anything.** This repo is a
  fork, forks ship with issues disabled, and `gh issue list` exits 1 in
  that state — under `set -euo pipefail` every drifted source would have
  turned the job red and reported nothing. Drift now always lands in the
  job summary; an issue is filed only when the tracker exists, deduped
  on exact title rather than relevance search.
- **A pinned tag could be shadowed by a branch.** `git clone --branch`
  resolves branches before tags; custom sources are fetched by
  `refs/tags/<tag>` and the vendored template's SHA is verified.
- **`--tag=v6.12.0` was silently ignored** and the sync ran against the
  pinned version instead, producing a tree every gate passes.
- Sibling help rows could zombie across a point release; the catalog is
  now reassembled rather than patched. A sibling's filtered
  skill-manifest is no longer materialized into the user's repo, where
  it replaced the 110-row aggregate with 15 rows. `--dry-run` no longer
  reports work it did not do. Throwaway checkouts moved under
  `.upstream-clones/` so one ignore rule covers them.

### Gates

`bun run validate` was rewritten so it cannot silently stop measuring:
the skill surface must equal the installer's own
`_config/skill-manifest.csv` in both directions; every declared plugin
must resolve to a directory whose `plugin.json` agrees with its
marketplace entry; every `plugins/<dir>` must be published; no vendored
file may carry the install-dir name, a non-placeholder `user_name`, or a
live nested `.gitignore`; registry and custom sources must pin a
`v`-prefixed tag and vendored sources a full 40-character SHA. Each gate
was mutation-verified — reintroducing the defect fails both
`bun run validate` and `bun run test:unit`.

## [6.10.0.0] - 2026-07-04

Upstream sync: bumps BMAD-METHOD core from v6.6.0 to v6.10.0 (through
v6.7 intent-based PRD/Brief, v6.8 planning-shape rework, v6.9
reasoning/orchestration upgrades, v6.10 bmad-loop era). Module bumps:
TEA v1.17.0 → v1.19.0, BMB v1.7.0 → v2.1.0, CIS v0.2.0 → v0.2.1, GDS
v0.4.0 → v0.6.0, plus the **new Loop module** (bmad-loop v0.8.0).
Skill count: **102 → 103** (42 BMM + 11 TEA + 4 BMB + 10 CIS + 33 GDS
+ 3 Loop) — upstream added 11 core-side skills, retired 9, this
plugin now **prunes upstream's 4 deprecated compatibility shims**
instead of shipping them, and the bmad-loop skill module contributes
3 more. 645 installer skill files changed (166 added, 265 deleted,
186 modified, 28 renamed).

### Added

- **Working-repo initializer.** Skills resolve per-project files from
  `{project-root}/_bmad/` (module config, shared scripts like
  `memlog.py` / `resolve_customization.py` — mandatory since v6.9's
  canonical memlog) which the immutable plugin cannot provide. New:
  - `plugins/bmad/runtime/_bmad/` — the installer's runtime tree
    (40 files), captured at sync time with the project name
    templatized as `__BMAD_PROJECT_NAME__` and deprecated-shim rows
    stripped from the `_config/*.csv` manifests. Nested `.gitignore`
    files are stored as `dot.gitignore` (a real one would exclude
    sibling template files from this repo — and marketplace installs
    are git clones); init.sh restores the real name.
  - `plugins/bmad/scripts/init.sh` — idempotent initializer: fills in
    missing `_bmad/` files (never overwrites), substitutes the real
    project name, creates the default output folders
    (`_bmad-output/*`, `docs/`, `skills/*-artifacts`). Supports
    `--dry-run` and a target-dir argument.
  - `plugins/bmad/commands/init.md` — `/bmad:init` slash command
    wrapping the script (plugin.json now declares `commands`).
- New upstream skills since v6.6.0: `bmad-prd`, `bmad-architecture`
  (ARCHITECTURE-SPINE rewrite), `bmad-ux` (DESIGN.md + EXPERIENCE.md),
  `bmad-spec`, `bmad-forge-idea`, `bmad-dev-auto` (unattended dev
  loop), `bmad-eval-runner`, and intent-based GDS consolidations
  `gds-gdd`, `gds-prd`, `gds-ux`, plus `gds-investigate`.
- **Loop module** (`bmad-code-org/bmad-loop` v0.8.0 — upstream v6.10's
  successor to bmad-automator). Not an npx-installer module: it is a
  Python orchestrator tool whose skill module ships inside its repo
  (`src/bmad_loop/data/skills/`). The sync clones the repo at the tag
  pinned in `.upstream-versions/loop.json` (`--loop-tag` to override)
  and copies `bmad-loop-setup` (installs/upgrades the orchestrator
  tool via `uv` and registers `_bmad/` config + help),
  `bmad-loop-resolve` (interactive CRITICAL-escalation resolution),
  and `bmad-loop-sweep` (deferred-work triage, automation-only). The
  release watcher (`sync-upstream.yml`) gained a `check-loop` job and
  the README version table / badges a Loop row.
- `scripts/sync-from-installer.ts`: `pruneDeprecatedSkills()` (drops
  any skill whose frontmatter description starts with `DEPRECATED`)
  and `captureRuntimeTemplate()` (copies `.upstream-install/_bmad/`
  into the plugin and templatizes it). `plugins/bmad/runtime/` is part
  of the wipe-and-regenerate cycle.
- Tests: `tests/plugin-tree.test.ts` (no deprecated shims, retired
  skills absent, new surface present, runtime template complete) and
  `tests/init-script.test.ts` (structure, name substitution,
  idempotency, `--dry-run`). `bun run validate` now also checks the
  runtime template, init assets, and the no-deprecated-shims
  invariant.

### Changed

- `plugins/bmad/skills/` regenerated from `npx bmad-method@6.10.0
  install --tools claude-code`. Headline upstream changes: PRD /
  Product Brief / Architecture / UX / GDD are single intent-based
  skills (create / update / validate detected from conversation);
  party-mode gained custom parties and persistent memory; shared
  append-only memlog (`uv run _bmad/scripts/memlog.py`) replaces
  per-skill decision logs; Edge Case Hunter gained severity triage.
- `plugins/bmad/README.md` rewritten — it still described the
  pre-v6.3 agent roster (`bmad-master`, `sm`, `quick-flow-solo-dev`)
  and old skill categories.
- `tests/e2e/skill-load.test.ts` smoke pool: `bmad-create-prd` →
  `bmad-prd`, `bmad-create-architecture` → `bmad-architecture`; added
  `bmad-spec` and `bmad-forge-idea`.
- `biome.json`: `plugins/bmad/skills/` and `plugins/bmad/runtime/`
  are fully excluded. Upstream v6.10 ships lintable assets (e.g.
  `report-shell.html`, `adapter-claude-code.json`) that biome would
  otherwise reformat, breaking the byte-for-byte mirror.
- `scripts/lib/bump-utils.ts`: idempotent re-sync no longer emits
  spurious `version not found` warnings when old == new version.
- Sync summary recounts files after pruning (was reporting the
  pre-prune copy count).

### Removed

- **Upstream deprecated shims are no longer shipped** (plugin policy:
  current surface only, no backwards compatibility):
  `bmad-create-prd`, `bmad-edit-prd`, `bmad-validate-prd`,
  `bmad-create-architecture` — all four are thin forwarders to
  `bmad-prd` / `bmad-architecture` slated for removal in upstream v7.
  Their rows are also stripped from the runtime template manifests.
- Retired upstream between v6.6.0 and v6.10.0 (absent from the
  regenerated tree): `bmad-distillator` (superseded by `bmad-spec`,
  v6.8), `bmad-create-ux-design` (replaced by `bmad-ux`, v6.8),
  `gds-create-gdd` / `gds-edit-gdd` / `gds-validate-gdd` /
  `gds-create-prd` / `gds-edit-prd` / `gds-validate-prd` /
  `gds-create-ux-design` (consolidated into `gds-gdd` / `gds-prd` /
  `gds-ux`, GDS v0.6.0). `bmad-investigate` (added v6.7, retired
  v6.10) never appeared in a plugin release.

### Breaking-change matrix (upstream v6.7.0 → v6.10.0)

| Upstream breaking change | Impact on this plugin |
| --- | --- |
| PRD/Brief/Architecture/UX consolidated into intent-based skills; old names shipped only as deprecated shims | Shims are pruned — invoke `bmad-prd`, `bmad-architecture`, `bmad-ux` directly. Existing `_bmad/custom/bmad-create-*.toml` overrides must be migrated to the new skill names. |
| `bmad-distillator` retired (v6.8), `bmad-investigate` retired (v6.10) | Removed from the plugin tree; use `bmad-spec` (and `gds-investigate` for game projects). |
| Python helpers standardized on `uv run` (v6.9; hard requirement in v7) | Skills invoke `uv run _bmad/scripts/*.py`; `/bmad:init` provisions the scripts, `uv` must be on PATH. |
| Community-modules picker + remote marketplace registry removed from installer (v6.7) | None — sync pins exact module set via `--modules bmm,bmb,cis,gds,tea`. |
| bmad-automator replaced by bmad-loop module (v6.10) | bmad-automator was never shipped; the bmad-loop skill module (v0.8.0) is now included, alongside core's `bmad-dev-auto`. The orchestrator tool installs via `/bmad:bmad-loop-setup`. |

## [6.6.0.0] - 2026-05-10

Upstream sync: bumps BMAD-METHOD core from v6.5.0 to v6.6.0 and TEA from
v1.15.1 to v1.17.0. BMB / CIS / GDS were already at the latest stable
GitHub tag (v1.7.0 / v0.2.0 / v0.4.0) and remain unchanged. Skill count
holds at **102**; only 3 skill files saw upstream content updates (the
new "Implementation Efficiency" guidance for `bmad-create-epics-and-stories`).

### Changed

- `plugins/bmad/skills/` regenerated from `npx bmad-method@6.6.0 install
  --tools claude-code`. The 3 modified skill files all live under
  `bmad-create-epics-and-stories` and `bmad-create-architecture` —
  upstream's brownfield epic-scoping enhancement (file-overlap detection
  + design-completeness gate).
- `.upstream-versions/tea.json`: v1.15.1 → v1.17.0 (skips v1.16.0).
  TEA v1.16.0 added Claude cowork support and renamed catalog
  relationships `after`/`before` → `preceded-by`/`followed-by`. v1.17.0
  bumped TEA's own GitHub Actions deps. Both are non-breaking from this
  plugin's perspective; the regenerated TEA skill content already
  reflects the renamed catalog columns.
- `scripts/sync-from-installer.ts:bumpModuleVersions()`: rewritten to
  read the canonical `_bmad/_config/manifest.yaml` produced by the
  v6.6.0 installer. The previous implementation matched a `version:`
  field in the per-module `_bmad/<mod>/config.yaml`, which no longer
  carries module-version metadata — those files now hold runtime config
  only. Without this fix, module bumps were silently no-ops, so TEA
  v1.16/v1.17 would not have been picked up.
- Sync flow re-ordered so `updateReadmeBadge()` runs *after*
  `bumpModuleVersions()` — otherwise the README badge and version table
  reflected stale module versions.

### Added

- Brownfield epic scoping principle in `bmad-create-epics-and-stories`
  (Implementation Efficiency: detect file-overlap between epics and
  consolidate when the same component is touched repeatedly). Upstream
  v6.6.0 feature.
- Upstream installer flags available transparently to end users running
  the installer directly: `--list-tools`, `--set <module>.<key>=<value>`
  (repeatable, with prototype-pollution defenses), `--list-options
  [module]`. Plugin builds keep using `--tools claude-code` exclusively.

### Removed

- Nothing on the plugin side. Upstream v6.6.0 auto-removes legacy
  pre-v6.2.0 wrapper skills (`bmad-bmm-*`, `bmad-agent-bmm-*`) on user
  install, but those have not been part of this plugin's tree since
  v6.5.0.0.

### Breaking-change matrix (from upstream v6.6.0)

| Upstream breaking change | Impact on this plugin |
| --- | --- |
| `--tools none` no longer accepted on fresh `--yes` installs | None — sync uses `--tools claude-code` (`scripts/sync-from-installer.ts:90-91`). |
| `project_name` moved from `[modules.bmm]` to `[core]` in `config.toml`; auto-migrated on user install | None — plugin tree carries no `config.toml`; this affects end-user installs only. |
| Pre-v6.2.0 wrapper skills `bmad-bmm-*` / `bmad-agent-bmm-*` auto-removed on upgrade | None — none of those names exist in `plugins/bmad/skills/`. |

## [6.5.0.1] - 2026-04-28

Architectural refactor: the plugin now sources its content directly
from the official `npx bmad-method install --tools claude-code`
output, replacing the multi-source git-clone-based sync pipeline.
**No upstream version change** — this release is purely a refactor of
how the plugin is built. The shipped skill content matches what
end-users get from the upstream installer byte-for-byte.

### Changed

- **Sync pipeline rewritten** as a thin wrapper around
  `npx bmad-method@<version> install --tools claude-code`. The
  installer is the single source of truth; the plugin does not perform
  any custom merging, path-rewriting, or per-source iteration.
- `plugins/bmad/skills/` regenerated from the installer output. Skill
  count: **102** (was 93). The 9 net new entries are: 3 research
  skills (`bmad-domain-research`, `bmad-market-research`,
  `bmad-technical-research`) that used to live nested under
  `skills/research/`; `bmad-tea` and 5 `gds-agent-*` skills that used
  to live as flat .md files in `agents/`; and `gds-document-project`
  which the old sync was missing entirely.
- `customize.toml` files: 86 → 90 (no longer missing for agent skills).

### Removed

- `plugins/bmad/agents/` directory (22 files). Agents are skills now;
  invoke via `/bmad:bmad-agent-pm` etc. instead of `Use the pm
  agent…`.
- `plugins/bmad/_shared/` directory. Replaced by per-skill
  `resources/` (e.g., each TEA testarch skill now ships its own
  `resources/tea-index.csv` instead of all sharing one in `_shared/`).
- `plugins/bmad/templates/` directory. Templates are inside their
  individual skill directories now.
- 4 zombie agents that were retired upstream in v6.3.0 and should
  never have survived the v6.5.0.0 wipe-and-regenerate: `sm.md`
  (Bob), `qa.md` (Quinn-as-broad-QA), `quick-flow-solo-dev.md`
  (Barry), `bmad-master.md` (BMad Master Orchestrator).
- 16 deleted scripts (≈3455 net lines removed). The old multi-source
  pipeline is gone:
  `sync-upstream-content.ts`, `sync-all.ts`, `generate-agents.ts`,
  `generate-skills.ts`, `generate-agent-manifest.ts`,
  `clean-orphaned-skills.ts`, `find-orphan-files.ts`, `bump-core.ts`,
  `bump-module.ts`, `lib/path-rewriter.ts`,
  `lib/workflow-iterator.ts`, plus 7 `lib/checks/*.ts` files.
- `package.json` scripts that backed the deleted scripts:
  `generate:agents`, `generate:skills`, `generate:manifest`,
  `sync-all`, `sync:source`, `clean:orphaned`, `find-orphans`,
  `find-orphans:delete`, `bump-core`, `bump-module`.

### Added

- `scripts/sync-from-installer.ts` — the new sync script (one
  command: `bun run sync`).
- `.upstream-install/` — git-ignored install output, fresh on each
  sync.
- `docs/plan-npx-resync.md` — the migration plan that drove this
  refactor.

### Fixed

- README's upstream-version table: drop "Released" column (we no
  longer keep git clones to read tag dates from).
- All references in source comments and example scripts updated to
  v6.5.0+ versions; legacy "v6.0.0-Beta.X" / "v6.2.2" / "v6.3.0"
  examples either bumped or labeled as historical.
- Test suite (`tests/e2e/skill-load.test.ts`) updated to use current
  prefixed skill names (`bmad-help`, `bmad-brainstorming`,
  `bmad-customize`, `bmad-tea`, `bmad-agent-pm`, …).

### Migration notes

If you previously installed the plugin and want the v6.5.0.1 layout:

```sh
claude plugin uninstall bmad@bmad-method
claude plugin install bmad@bmad-method@v6.5.0.1
```

The installed cache will then contain only `skills/` (plus the
`.claude-plugin/` manifest and the marketplace README) — no
`agents/`, no `_shared/`, no `templates/`. Agent personas are
invoked via slash commands like `/bmad:bmad-tea`.

## [6.5.0.0] - 2026-04-27

Regression-style upgrade: no backward compatibility with pre-v6.5 layouts.
The plugin tree was wiped and rebuilt purely from v6.5.0-era upstream
sources to guarantee zero leftover artifacts from earlier versions.

### Added

- New core skill `bmad-customize` (v6.5.0): authors per-skill `[agent]` /
  `[workflow]` TOML overrides for installed BMAD skills.
- `customize.toml` authoring pattern adopted across BMM and core skills.
- `module.yaml` and `module-help.csv` introduced at module roots (core, BMM).
- Path-rewriter passthrough for v6.5.0 user-side aliases:
  `_bmad/scripts/`, `_bmad/custom/`, `_bmad/planning/`.

### Changed

- Sync core BMAD-METHOD v6.3.0 → v6.5.0 (skipping v6.4.0 — direct upgrade).
- Sync upstream TEA v1.12.2 → v1.15.1 (TEA agent moved to SKILL.md format).
- Sync upstream BMB v1.4.0 → v1.7.0.
- Sync upstream CIS v0.1.9 → v0.2.0.
- Sync upstream GDS v0.3.0 → v0.4.0.
- `sync-upstream-content.ts` now delegates JSON version bumps to
  `bump-utils.updateJsonVersionFiles()` so `marketplace.json` is updated
  alongside `package.json` and `plugin.json`.
- TEA v1.15.1 ships its agent as a SKILL.md instead of a YAML file.
- `gds-agent-game-qa` and `gds-agent-game-scrum-master` registered as
  plugin-only agents (no upstream counterpart in GDS v0.4.0).

### Removed

- All v6.2/v6.3 backward-compat fallbacks in
  `scripts/clean-orphaned-skills.ts` (legacy `src/core/skills/` and
  `src/core/workflows/` candidate paths).
- Legacy fallback in `scripts/lib/path-rewriter.ts`
  `addCoreSpecialWorkflows()` (only `src/core-skills/` is checked).
- Stale `bmad-skill-manifest.yaml` and `workflow.md` files no longer
  shipped by upstream (already filtered by `skipContentFiles`, removed
  from disk via the wipe + rebuild).

### Fixed

- `marketplace.json` version drift: was stuck at v6.2.0.4 because the
  inline version-update block in `sync-upstream-content.ts` only touched
  `package.json` and `plugin.json`. Now bumps to v6.5.0.0 like the
  others.

> **Reconstructed entries (6.0.3.4 → 6.3.0.2)** — these releases were tagged
> on the upstream `PabloLION/bmad-plugin` fork during the Feb–Apr 2026 window
> while the CHANGELOG was unmaintained. Entries are reconstructed from git
> log + tag metadata.

## [6.3.0.2] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- Sync core BMAD-METHOD v6.2.2 → v6.3.0
- Sync TEA v1.7.3 → v1.12.2
- Sync GDS v0.2.2 → v0.3.0

### Added

- `find-orphan-files.ts` script — detects stale files inside surviving plugin
  skill directories (orphaned by upstream renames mid-skill, not caught by
  `clean-orphaned-skills.ts` which only handles whole directories)
- `bmad-checkpoint-preview` skill (NEW in core v6.3.0)
- `bmad-prfaq` skill (Working Backwards PRFAQ challenge)

### Removed

- `bmad-init` skill (config now loads from `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml`)
- `bmad-agent-qa`, `bmad-agent-quick-flow-solo-dev`, `bmad-agent-sm` skill
  dirs (Barry/Quinn/Bob personas consolidated into Developer Amelia upstream)

> **Note:** this tag was merged "for local testing" so the user's fork could
> be used as a Claude Code marketplace before the upstream PR landed. There
> is no v6.3.0.0 / v6.3.0.1 — the plugin patch jumped to .2 to reflect the
> two iteration commits during the test cycle.
